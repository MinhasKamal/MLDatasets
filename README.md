# MLDatasets
### A collection of popular machine learning datasets

This repo provides an unencoded, raw version of small datasets or subsets of large datasets. It is intended to help researchers and developers quickly run experiments or build demos without the hassle of dealing varying download procedures, encodings, or labeling formats of datasets. For large datasets, only a subset is extracted to allow for easier access and processing.
